BRAIN TUMOR CLASSIFICATION

OVERVIEW

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to classify brain tumor types using medical images. The model is trained to classify images into four categories: glioma, pituitary tumor, meningioma, and no tumor.

FEATURES

1.Input images are preprocessed using OpenCV, a powerful library for image processing in Python.

2.The deep neural network architecture is implemented using Keras, which includes Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layers for feature extraction.

3.The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 97%, making it highly reliable for brain tumor classification.

4.Seaborn is used for visualization of model performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.

USAGE

Prepare your dataset of brain images, ensuring they are labeled with the corresponding tumor types.

Preprocess the images using OpenCV, ensuring they are appropriately formatted for input into the model.

Train the deep neural network model using the provided Python script.

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deploy the trained model for real-world classification tasks, such as diagnosing brain tumors from medical images.
